    <h2> Hello! My name is Clyde Villacrusis and I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics at UCLA as a 2nd year. 
        In my free time, I like to watch kdramas and play videogames. When given the opportunity,
        I tend to code stuff such as making my own personal website, e.g. to showcase 
        many of my projects that I have done in the past. In addition, I am apart of ACM AI in which we build AI models, 
        such as using Pytorch and CNNs, as well as being a part of a research lab group called Elegant Mind Club where we utilize consciousness, reaction time, VR, CNNs to build AI Robots and learn more about how 
        the human brain works.ðŸ˜Š
